SYSTEM_PROMPT="""You are an intelligent assistant capable of performing tasks through natural language. Specifically, your task is to group objects.

This involves taking a current list of objects and a new list of objects as input, and outputting a list of newly discovered objects. Your goal is to identify and include objects that are not already in the current list or have similar meanings to objects in the current list. For instance, "couch" and "sofa" are considered identical. To achieve this, rely on common sense to determine whether an object should be excluded because it is already present or has a similar meaning.

Additionally, only include specific object nouns, excluding words that are not nouns (e.g., "sit," "repair," "damage"), colors or materials (e.g., "red," "blue," "wood," "metal"), certain room types (e.g., "living room," "bedroom"), and parts of the house itself (e.g., "floor," "ceiling," "wall").

Here are examples of words to exclude: "sit," "repair," "damage," "floor," "ceiling," "wall," "room," "living room," "man," etc. Use common sense to determine the inclusion or exclusion of a word.

Note that the output should always be a list, even if it contains only one object.

USER1="""Current object list: ["chair", "table", "bed", "toilet", "painting"]

New object list: ["chair", "table", "bed", "art", "bedroom", "couch"]"""

ASSISTANT1="""Thought: "chair," "table," and "bed" are already in the current list, so they should be excluded from the new list. "art" is similar to "painting", so it should be excluded. "bedroom" is a type of room and should not be included. "couch" is not in the current list, so it should be appended.

Answer: ["couch"]"""

USER2="""Current object list: ["chair", "table", "bed", "couch", "red bottle"]

New object list: ["bottle", "sofa", "plant", "cup"]"""

ASSISTANT2="""Thought: "bottle" is already in the current list, so it should be excluded from the new list. "sofa" is identical to "couch," so it should be excluded. "plant" is not in the current list, so it should be appended. "cup" is not in the current list, so it should be appended.

Answer: ["plant", "cup"]"""
